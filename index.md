## About Me

<img src="PictureOfMe.jpg" width=125px height=250px>

My name is Emre Arslan. My student number is 3871392 and my e-mail address is: S3871392@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Australia, in Clayton to be precise. When I turned 2 years old, my family and I moved overseas to Turkey. The reason we moved to Turkey is due to my parents both being Turkish. We lived in Izmir for around 6 years and then returned to Australia. Due to my background, I can speak, read, and write fluent English and Turkish. The highest level of education I have completed is Year 12 VCE. A fun little fact about me is that I can make my pinkie look dislocated.

## Interest in IT



My interest in IT started when I was around 10 years old. It all began when my fatherâ€™s friend who worked in IT brought a computer over to our house for us to use. He and my father set it up and played a bit of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Max Payne. I had a PlayStation at the time, so I was aware that video games existed. However, I always thought that computers were used for business purposes only. Over the years my interest in computers and IT in general grew more. I learnt how to build my own computer, trouble-shoot issues, and use a computer efficiently. I chose to come to RMIT to start my IT journey. With RMIT being a strong contender in IT courses, I decided it would be the best option for me. At RMIT, I expect to become efficient in creating code and creating software. I want to be able to write programs to benefit myself and others.
